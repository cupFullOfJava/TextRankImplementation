The vertex that casts the vote is also taken into consideration. 
Co-occurrence is not important here because it is highly unlikely that a sentence will be repeated more than once. 
Similarity can be determined by using a number of open class words as common tokens. 
The length of the sentences is also taken into consideration by using a normalization factor. 
To normalize, the content overlap of two sentences can be divided by the length of each sentence. 
After the ranking algorithm is run on the graph, sentences are sorted in reversed order of their score, and the top ranked sentences are selected for inclusion in the summary.
