This is what TextRank is.
TextRank is a graph based ranking algorithm, which decides on the importance of a vertex within a graph. It
uses global information recursively computed from the entire graph, rather than relying only on local
vertex-specific information. When one vertex links to another in the graph it is basically casting a vote for
that other vertex. The higher the number of votes, the higher the importance. The vertex that casts the
vote is also taken into consideration. The score associated with a vertex is determined based on the votes
that are cast for it, and the score of the vertices casting these votes.
This concept can be applied to automatic summarization first by constructing a weighted graph that
represents the text. A vertex is added to the graph for each sentence. Co-occurrence is not important here
because it is highly unlikely that a sentence will be repeated more than once. The relationship that is
considered for sentence extraction is the similarity between two sentences. Similarity can be determined by
using a number of open class words as common tokens. The length of the sentences is also taken into
consideration by using a normalization factor. To normalize, the content overlap of two sentences can be
divided by the length of each sentence.
After the ranking algorithm is run on the graph, sentences are sorted in reversed order of their score, and
the top ranked sentences are selected for inclusion in the summary.
